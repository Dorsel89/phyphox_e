# phyphox:e
## technical capabilities
Both voltage channels and the current measurement channel can be readout individually or successively. The maximum data rate depends on the number of used channels *n* and can be up to $\frac{4.26 Mhz}{n}$.
### voltage measurement
Number of Channels: 2  <br/>
Measurement Range: ±14V <br/>
Resolution (without oversampling): 12bit, ~7mV <br/>
**live mode:** measured data will be send continuously to phyphox. <br/>
**oscilloscope mode:** 

### current measurement
The ampere meter feature can be used in different gain modes. A low gain enables measurements between ±3A with a resolution of ~1mA. In high gain mode measurements between ±15mA with a resolution of 7μA.

### signal generator
The signal generator is able to generate constant voltages or simple functions (sine, cosine, triangular, sawtooth). <br/>

## phyphox-Experiments
phyphox experiments for the phyphox:e sensorbox can be found  [**here**](https://github.com/Dorsel89/phyphox_e_experiments)

## Configuration
Each sensor can be configured via a specific charateristic.
